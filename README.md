# PursueSTEM
Hello! This is Darby's github for Pursue STEM at University of Toronto. In the folders above will be the files you need to complete relevant activities.

Documents that end in .ipynb can be opened in your browser using a website called "Google Colab" without installing any software to your machine.
If you are working with a python file that opens a .csv or other file type within it, you'll need to add that file to your Google Colab workspace before you can run the code successfully.
