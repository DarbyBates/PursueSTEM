Steps to open and run the Spotify Activity Python Code:

3. Once you have selected this file, a new browser tab should open with the title "Spotify Activity.ipynb".
4. On the upper left-hand side of the screen are a few buttons that are symbols. Look below the below the symbol '{x}'. Click on the symbol of a folder you see there. 
5. A Files tab should open, and you can click on the symbol of a piece of paper with an arrow pointing straight up into the paper. This is the "Upload to session storage" button.
6. Select the "for_students.csv" file you downloaded in step 0.
7. In the menu bar at the top of the page is a "Runtime" tab. Click "Runtime", then "Run all"
8. If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you should see a plot of Energy versus Positiveness (valence) for a few musical artists.
